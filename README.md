Welcome to the Game Minesweeper.


How to play?:
You play by clicking somewhere on the field to reveal a tile.
Under that tile can be a bomb, a number or nothing.

If you click on nothing or a number, you are safe.
The number indicates how many bombs are on adjacent tiles.
If you click on a bomb, then you loose.

You can always start a new game by clicking on the big smiley in the middle.


How to win?:
The goal is to reveal the entire minefield without stepping on a mine.
So you win, if you revealed every tile that doesnt have a bomb.


Features: 

When you suspect that a tile has a bomb, you can put a flag on a field with right click that makes it impossible for you to click on it on accident.
It can always be removed again.

If there is a whole bunch of nothing in a bigger area, dont worry. You wont need to click every tile. Instead it will be revealed automatically.

A more advanced feature is that you can click on a number and when there is the same amount of flags around it, it will automatically reveal the tiles the adjacent tiles that dont have a flag.
But be careful. If your flag is wrong, then it might reveal a bomb and you loose.
